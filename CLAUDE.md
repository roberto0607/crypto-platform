# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

TRADR is a competitive crypto paper trading platform. Users trade BTC/ETH/SOL with simulated balances, compete in 1v1 matches with ELO rankings, and analyze markets with professional-grade chart indicators.

- **Monorepo**: pnpm workspaces — `apps/api/` (Fastify/TypeScript) + `apps/web/` (Vite/React)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL 16 via raw SQL (`pg` pool, no ORM) + Redis for distributed state
- **Deployment**: Railway — separate web and API services
  - Frontend: `gallant-reprieve-production.up.railway.app`
  - API: `crypto-platform-production-691d.up.railway.app`
- **Auth**: Argon2 + JWT access tokens + HttpOnly refresh cookie rotation
- **Trading**: Simulated order book with limit/market orders, slippage model, TP/SL/trailing stop triggers

## Build & Development Commands

All commands run from `apps/api/`:

```bash
pnpm dev              # Start dev server with hot reload (tsx watch, port 3001)
pnpm typecheck        # Type-check without emitting (tsc --noEmit)
pnpm migrate          # Run database migrations
```

Start PostgreSQL before running the API:
```bash
docker compose up -d  # Start PostgreSQL (port 5435) + Redis
```

## Indicator Roadmap

**Status: Stages 1–6 are all shipped and in prod. The roadmap is complete.**

### Already Built (pre-roadmap)
EMA 20/50/200, VWAP, Bollinger Bands, Volume bars, RSI(14), CVD, Key Levels (PDH/PDL), Liquidity Zones, Order Blocks, Market Intelligence composite score

### ✅ Stage 1 — shipped (e0edb0b, 2026-04-02)
- MACD (12/26/9)
- ATR (Average True Range, 14-period)
- Per-candle delta (buy volume - sell volume as histogram)

### ✅ Stage 2 — shipped (342fc9f, 2026-04-04)
- Funding Rate overlay
- Open Interest chart
- **Data source: Gate.io + OKX (OI), Deribit (funding) — NOT Binance.** Binance fapi and Bybit are geo-blocked from US Railway servers; the commit subject says "Binance API" but the live code uses US-accessible exchanges. See `apps/api/src/routes/v1/v1Market.ts`.

### ✅ Stage 3 — shipped (e2d61b6, 2026-04-08)
- Volume Profile / VPVR (price-level volume histogram, with POC line + visible/weekly/daily modes)

### ✅ Stage 4 — shipped (749a3bf / 5d8832c, 2026-04-08–09)
- Order Book Heatmap (LEFT side of chart)
- Footprint Charts (Kraken trade aggregation, BTC/USD only — see footprint aggregator note in docs)
- Absorption detection (`detectAbsorption()` in `apps/web/src/lib/footprintPrimitive.ts`)

### ✅ Stage 5 — shipped (e4de89a, 2026-04-13)
- Liquidation Levels (estimated, BTC only)
- COT Report integration (CFTC)
- Multi-exchange Open Interest (Gate.io + OKX for BTC)

### ✅ Stage 6 — shipped (PRs #78–#81, 2026-06-24)
- Post-Match Replay — auto-playing candle-by-candle replay of a completed 1v1 at `/matches/:id/replay`: split candle chart (entry ▲/▼ + exit trade markers per player) on top, dual P&L "race" (challenger orange / opponent cyan, 0% baseline) below, with Play/Pause/Restart + scrubber + 1×/2×/4×. Reached via the **REPLAY** button on COMPLETED Arena match-history rows.
- **How it works**: `GET /v1/matches/:id/replay` reconstructs each player's per-candle P&L from `match_positions` × 5m candles (`apps/api/src/competitions/replay/`). The reconstruction is unit + oracle tested — the curve's final point equals the stored headline `*_pnl_pct` (oracle delta ~1e-15). Backend is the source of truth; the frontend never recomputes P&L.
- **Shipped across**: #78 (windowed 5m candle backfill, Coinbase — Kraken can't serve deep 5m), #79 (reconcile demo `match_positions` P&L to the stored headline so the oracle is satisfiable), #80 (endpoint + pure reconstruction + tests), #81 (UI).
- **⚠️ KNOWN LIMITATION — replay works on demo/seeded matches only.** `match_positions` is populated *only by the seed* (`matchService.ts` calls it "deprecated"); real matches use the non-temporal `positions` aggregate (no side/entry/exit/open-close), so they return a friendly "no replay available" (`no_replay_data`, 422). Enabling real-match replay needs a per-trade event log (or an `equity_snapshots`-based curve) — a clean future enhancement, not a bug.
- **Route distinction (don't confuse)**: `/matches/:id/replay` is THIS post-match replay; `/replay` is the unrelated **solo historical-candle practice** subsystem (`replay_sessions`, `apps/api/src/replay/`, `replay.ts`).

### ✅ Sub-panel hover + live-update refinements — shipped (PRs #83–#94, 2026-06-24)
*Polish on already-built indicators, NOT a new roadmap stage — the roadmap stays complete.*
- **Hover readouts** — ALL EIGHT trade-page sub-panels have TradingView-style hover readouts (header switches `hovered ?? latest`, plus a synced vertical crosshair marker). Hover is now **DUAL** (#93/#94): every panel updates BOTH when hovering the price chart (the main crosshair projects a marker onto the panel) AND when hovering the panel ITSELF (its own native crosshair), all through one shared `usePanelCrosshairHover` hook. The three lookup variants describe how each panel resolves the value: EXACT-match (data 1:1 with candles) — RSI, CVD, MACD (3-value — macd/signal/hist), ATR, Delta; STEP-lookup (value *in effect* at the cursor time, for sparse series) — Funding, OI; COT is **self-only** (folded into the hook with `mainChart: null`, `CrosshairMode.Magnet`) — its weekly-UTC domain can't main-sync, so it responds to hovering itself only.
- **Live-update** — RSI, MACD, and ATR all recompute intra-candle on `sse:price.tick` so their last point tracks live, not just on candle close (#84 RSI, #89 MACD/ATR). All three are price-derived (RSI/ATR on H/L/C, MACD on close EMAs), so they share ONE throttle gate + one forming-candle series build per tick (`lastLiveIndicatorComputeRef` + `LIVE_INDICATOR_THROTTLE_MS`) — total recompute stays ~1/sec regardless of how many are on. CVD/Delta can't live-update on tick (they need volume, which `price.tick` doesn't carry — they stay candle-close cadence); Funding/OI/COT are external/slow (live-update N/A).
- **Range-sync crash fix (#87)** — a latent `Value is null` (lightweight-charts throws when `setVisibleRange`/`setVisibleLogicalRange` runs before a panel's series has data) is now guarded across all eight range-syncing panels (RSI/Volume/CVD/Delta/MACD/ATR/Funding/OI) — the handler no-ops until the panel has data.
- **Reusable patterns** (breadcrumbs): hover lives in one shared hook — `src/hooks/usePanelCrosshairHover.ts`, generic over `T`, driven by a per-panel `lookup(time) => { value, price } | null` callback (the only per-panel variance: exact `param.time === point.time`, step `last point with time <= cursor`, or COT's week map — all on `TZ_OFFSET_SEC`-adjusted times so they're comparable). It subscribes BOTH the main chart crosshair (projects a marker via `setCrosshairPosition`) AND the panel's OWN chart crosshair (no `setCrosshairPosition` — the native crosshair already draws it). KEY library fact that makes dual-hover safe: `setCrosshairPosition`/`clearCrosshairPosition` pass `skipEvent=true`, so the main path's programmatic crosshair never re-fires the own subscription — the two can't cross-fire. Each panel = one `useState` + one `lookup`; eight panels, one tested hook. Live-update = recompute on `sse:price.tick`, throttled. Always guard range-sync until the panel has data.
- **PRs**: #83 (RSI hover), #84 (RSI live-update), #85 (CVD/MACD/ATR/Delta hover), #86 (Funding/OI step-lookup hover), #87 (range-sync guard), #89 (MACD/ATR live-update), #91 (COT self-contained hover), #93 (extract `usePanelCrosshairHover`), #94 (self-hover for all panels via the hook).
- **Remaining trade-page polish** (tracked, not a roadmap): real-match replay enablement (see the Stage 6 limitation — needs a real match played + a per-trade event log); the expand/collapse mount/unmount `Object is disposed` race (pre-existing, unrelated to hover — a stray paint after `chart.remove()`) — candidate for a guard like #87's range-sync fix.

**Rule**: Build each indicator correctly before moving to the next. No deadlines. Quality over speed.

## Architecture Rules

### Indicators
All new indicators follow this pattern:
1. Computation function in `apps/web/src/lib/indicators.ts`
2. Boolean toggle in `defaultIndicatorConfig` in `apps/web/src/stores/tradingStore.ts`
3. Entry in `IndicatorToolbar.tsx` (STANDARD or ADVANCED section)
4. Overlay indicators: add `LineSeries` in `CandlestickChart.tsx` `renderOverlays()`
5. Sub-panel indicators: create a synced panel component like `CvdPanel.tsx` / `RsiPanel.tsx`
6. All indicator defaults are OFF — user enables what they want
7. Sub-panels use time-based range sync (`getVisibleRange`/`setVisibleRange`), not logical index

### Sub-Panel Height Constants
- Minimum height: 40px (drag clamp)
- Default expanded: 80px (Volume, RSI, Delta), 100px (MACD), 120px (ATR), 60px (CVD)
- Collapsed height: 20px (SubPanelHeader label bar only)
- Maximum height: 400px (drag clamp)
- Heights persisted in localStorage key `tradr_panel_heights`

### Auth & Cookies
- Production uses `sameSite: "none"` + `secure: true` (cross-origin Railway deployment)
- Dev uses `sameSite: "lax"` (Vite proxy makes it same-origin)
- **Never change cookie config without checking `config.isProd` condition**

### Error Handling
- Never use `process.exit()` silently — always log before exiting
- Migration guard throws errors (not `process.exit`) so they propagate to the top-level catch

### Triggers (TP/SL)
- Frontend trigger endpoints use `/v1/triggers` and `/v1/oco` prefix
- Fastify JSON schema must match Zod schema for all allowed `kind` values
- `TRAILING_STOP_MARKET` requires `trailingOffset` in both schemas

## Known Issues (do not re-introduce)

- **Multi-tab token refresh race**: Two browsers/tabs as the same user can trigger concurrent refresh rotations, causing token reuse detection and family revocation. Deferred — known limitation of the rotation security model.
- **Demo user created directly in DB**: The `demo@demo.local` account was not created through the normal auth flow. Always verify wallets exist before match start. Wallets were manually inserted.
- **`orders.competition_id` FK points to `competitions` table, NOT `matches`**: Do not set `activeCompetitionId` to a match UUID — it causes FK violation on order placement.

## Database

- **Production**: Use Railway's `DATABASE_PUBLIC_URL` for local→production queries. Fetch the current value at use time via `railway run --service Postgres bash -c 'echo $DATABASE_PUBLIC_URL'` — do not embed it (even masked) in tracked files.
- **Local dev**: `postgresql://cp:cp@localhost:5435/cp`
- **Migrations**: Plain SQL in `apps/api/migrations/`, tracked in `schema_migrations`. Always register in `schema_migrations` when applying manually.
- **Demo user ID**: `5b44aeb6-81c4-4131-bd06-b87e6fe89f11`
- **Rtirado user ID (production)**: `338d993f-0444-4a0a-b463-d3cb6ce0d959`
- **Risk/governance subsystem removed (migration 059, 2026-05-18)**: `circuit_breakers`, `account_limits`, `incidents`/`incident_events`, `reconciliation_reports`, `repair_runs`, `risk_limits`, `user_quotas` were dropped as "exchange-complexity ... unnecessary for paper trading". Order placement no longer gates on them. **Do not reference these tables** — they no longer exist. Anything describing circuit breakers, account quarantine, or incident governance as live behavior is stale.
- **⚠️ Incomplete 059 cleanup (dead code, follow-up)**: live `src/` still references the dropped tables — `routes/healthRoutes.ts:92` queries `circuit_breakers` (so `/health` may 500), `outbox/outboxProcessor.ts:47` writes to `incidents` via `openIncidentsForQuarantinedUsers` (reconciliation-gated), and the whole `src/incidents/` module + `routes/v1/v1Incidents.ts` target dropped tables. Tracked in `docs/followups.md`.

## Coding Principles

- **Diagnose before fixing** — always show relevant code and findings before suggesting changes
- **Permanent fixes only** — no patches that mask root causes
- **Commit after each logical fix** — not batched across unrelated changes
- **Frontend validation never replaces backend validation** — both are required
- **Typecheck before committing**: `cd apps/api && npx tsc --noEmit` and `cd apps/web && npx tsc --noEmit`

## Key Patterns

- **No ORM** — all database access uses raw SQL via `pg` Pool
- **Audit logging** — `audit_log` table captures actor, action, target, request context, and JSONB metadata
- **Refresh token rotation** — tokens stored as hashes with expiry, reuse detection, and family revocation
- **Paper trading** — platform uses simulated balances only; `debitUnconstrainedTx()` allows negative balance for short sells
- **Order-book exchange model** — market maker bot provides liquidity; real limit order matching with price-time priority

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Required | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `DATABASE_URL` | **yes** | — | PostgreSQL connection string |
| `JWT_ACCESS_SECRET` | **yes** | — | HMAC secret for access tokens |
| `PORT` | no | `3001` | HTTP listen port |
| `HOST` | no | `0.0.0.0` | HTTP listen host |
| `NODE_ENV` | no | `development` | `development` or `production` |
| `CORS_ORIGINS` | no | localhost:5173,3000 | Comma-separated allowed origins |
| `REDIS_URL` | no | — | Redis connection (empty = local-only mode) |
| `DISABLE_RATE_LIMIT` | no | `false` | Skip rate limiting (dev/load test) |
| `DISABLE_JOB_RUNNER` | no | `false` | Skip background jobs (load test) |

## Visual verification: Playwright MCP

Playwright MCP is wired into Claude Code at user scope. Use it BEFORE
asking Roberto for DevTools screenshots — it pays for itself the moment
the question is "does this element exist / what are its computed styles
/ does it overlap something."

### When to reach for it

- Any "is X rendering?" question about the running app
- DOM structure / computed style questions (width, display, flex,
  overflow, min-width)
- "Does the layout break at viewport Y?"
- Smoke-testing a UI change end-to-end before committing
- Reproducing a visual bug Roberto described

Do NOT use it for: questions answerable from source code alone, unit
test failures, type errors, or anything where the answer is in the repo.

### How to invoke

Mention "playwright mcp" explicitly the first time in a session:

    Use playwright mcp to open http://localhost:5173/trade and ...

After the first call, "use playwright" or "open the page" is enough.

### Prereqs the tool needs

- Dev servers must be running on :5173 (web) and :3001 (api). If they're
  not, start them yourself with `pnpm dev` in the respective app dir,
  background them with `>/tmp/tradr-{api,web}.log 2>&1 &`, and poll
  with curl until both return 200 before navigating.
- /trade requires auth. There's no .env with test credentials. Options:
  ask Roberto, or register a fresh throwaway account via the signup
  flow (local DB gets reseeded regularly so throwaways are cheap).

### Diagnostic prompt template

For DOM/CSS investigations, capture data structurally rather than just
screenshots — screenshots are good for the final visual but bad for
answering questions like "what's the computed flex value":

1. Navigate, wait for the target component to render
2. querySelectorAll the parent, list every child's className +
   computed width + display + flex
3. For specific suspects, dump display, flex, min-width, width,
   max-width, overflow
4. Test at multiple viewport widths if a media query might be involved
5. Screenshot final state for Roberto's visual confirmation

### Verify the correct selector before reporting "missing"

A null querySelector result means EITHER the element doesn't exist OR
the selector is wrong. Always grep the source for the class name first:

    grep -rn "tr-cr-ohlc" apps/web/src

If the class doesn't appear in source, the selector is wrong. Don't
report "missing from DOM" until you've confirmed the class name is
spelled correctly. (Real example from May 2026: `.tr-cr-ohlcv` was
queried for an hour before it turned out the actual class is
`.tr-cr-ohlc` — no V.)

### Privacy note

Everything Playwright sees goes to Anthropic's API as tool input. Fine
for localhost with fake/paper-trading data. Don't point it at Railway
prod with real account state unless Roberto explicitly asks.

# Recently shipped

- **Indicator Roadmap Stages 1–5 deployed** (MACD/ATR/Delta, Funding/OI, VPVR, Heatmap/Footprint/Absorption, Liquidation/COT/multi-exchange OI). Funding/OI use Gate.io + OKX + Deribit, not Binance (US geo-block). See the Indicator Roadmap section for commits/dates.

## Match-scoped positions bug (FIXED 2026-05-22, PR #26)

The Redis queue flattened `matchId = undefined` (the route's "look it up
server-side" signal) to `""` at enqueue and back to `null` at dequeue, so every
in-match order/position in prod was written with `match_id = NULL`. Worked
locally because the in-memory queue preserved `undefined`; broke under Redis
only.

Four downstream consequences, all healed by the same fix:
- LMV positions invisible (read filter `WHERE match_id = $activeMatchId` found
  nothing → no close button → users forfeited to escape)
- Orphan positions appeared on free-play `/trade` after forfeit
  (`WHERE match_id IS NULL` matched)
- `cancelActiveMatch`'s "has filled trades?" gate was structurally 0 (reopened
  the cancel-to-dodge-ELO exploit that 7924b58 was supposed to close)
- `closeMatchScopedPositions` on completeMatch/forfeitMatch found zero rows
  (match P&L missed in-match positions)

Prod evidence at fix time: 42 FILLED orders across 8 distinct matches placed
with `match_id = NULL`; 7 of 8 matches FORFEITED, confirming the behavioral
hypothesis. Migration 066 confirmed applied 2026-04-25 — column existed, queue
write path stopped populating it.

Fix: resolve `matchId` at the HTTP edge in `tradingRoutes.ts` (call
`getActiveMatchIdForUser` before enqueueing) and carry concrete `string | null`
through the queue. Across Redis, `null` serializes as a distinct
`__free_play__` sentinel (never `""`); dequeue maps it back symmetrically, with
`""`/missing defensively mapped to `null` for backward compat with pre-fix
queued jobs. `phase6OrderService`'s `getActiveMatchIdForUser` fallback was
REMOVED — a wrong null now surfaces as the symptom rather than being silently
re-resolved.

Verified end-to-end in prod 2026-05-22 12:01 PM: challenged demo from
rtirado0607, both sides in LMV opened opposite positions, CLOSE POSITION button
appeared in both, positions closed cleanly with P&L recorded.

Existing orphans NOT bulk-cleaned — closed manually as encountered. The fix
only prevents new orphans.

Known follow-ups (backlog, not blocking):
- Race window: order placed at match-completion boundary could stamp a
  just-ended matchId. Mitigation: closeMatchScopedPositions sweep after match
  completion (already runs, but could drain in-flight queue jobs first).
- Add a Redis-queue integration test so this class of bug can't regress
  silently (existing tests only exercised the in-memory path).
- Extract custom-header allowlist to shared constants module (so client
  interceptor + server CORS can't drift like X-Competition-Id did — same shape
  of bug as the matchId one).

# Top of mind

TRADR is in a **stable, well-instrumented state** after yesterday's four PRs:
the matchId-via-Redis bug (PR #26) + its regression test (PR #27), the
per-consumer blocking-connection fix (PR #28), and the chart toolbar fit fix
(PR #29 — all five cells visible, Indicators gear no longer clipped). Trade
open/close latency is sub-second under all queue conditions, not just when the
market-maker bot is active.

**Indicator Roadmap Stages 1–6 are shipped and in prod**: Stage 1 (MACD 12/26/9,
ATR 14, per-candle delta), Stage 2 (Funding Rate, Open Interest), Stage 3 (VPVR),
Stage 4 (Order Book Heatmap, Footprint), Stage 5 (Liquidation Levels, COT report,
multi-exchange OI), **Stage 6 (Post-Match Replay — shipped PRs #78–#81)**. The
indicator/competitive roadmap is now complete (Stage 6 replay works on demo
matches only — real-match replay needs a per-trade event log; see the Stage 6
section).

**Next focus: shift from feature work to scaling/observability.** Current user
load is tiny, but the codebase is now mature enough that "can it handle real
users?" is the right question. First step: load-test to find current limits.
A k6 harness already exists from Phase 10 PR1 (`apps/api/load/k6/` — 5 scenarios
+ `apps/api/docs/slo-baseline.md`) but hasn't been run against the codebase since
March; revisit it, record real baseline numbers in slo-baseline.md, and extend
coverage to the indicator/derivatives endpoints added since. See
[docs/postmortems/](docs/postmortems/) for the matchId bug writeup.

## Known dev env oddities

- **Leftover cp_postgres container on port 5433**: belongs to the
  unrelated ai_trading_agent project (volume
  aitradingagent_cp_postgres_data, DB=ai_trading_agent), NOT TRADR.
  Ignore it. TRADR's compose correctly defines tradr_postgres on
  port 5435 (volume crypto-platform_tradr_postgres_data, DB=cp),
  which is what `docker compose up -d` actually starts. The compose
  file is correct; the confusing part is just that an unrelated
  project squats on the cp_postgres name+5433.

- **kalshi-edge-postgres on 5434**: also unrelated, belongs to the
  kalshi-edge project. Mentioned only because it sometimes shows up
  in `docker ps` and might cause confusion if you forget which
  containers belong to which projects.
